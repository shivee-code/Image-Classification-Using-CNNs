# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNNs

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the [CIFAR-10 dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), a standard benchmark dataset in computer vision. The model is trained, evaluated, and improved using different techniques in this educational deep learning assignment.
